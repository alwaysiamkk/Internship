* Download or Install `Packer` from [here] (https://www.packer.io/downloads) or install using `brew` (you need 'homebrew' package manager from 
```bash 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
for using 'brew' command)
```bash
brew install packer
```

* Check that Packer has installed by running any Packer command like
```bash
packer version
```
if this command returns some version number of packer, then Packer has installed properly else try redoing the above step.

* Once verified, make a directory structure
