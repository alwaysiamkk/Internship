# TCP :handshake:

- The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is a transport protocol that is used **on top of IP** to **ensure reliable transmission of packets**.
- TCP includes **mechanisms** to solve many of the problems that arise from packet-based messaging, such as **lost** packets, **out of order** packets, **duplicate** packets, and **corrupted** packets.
- Since TCP is the protocol used most commonly on top of IP, the Internet protocol stack is sometimes referred to as **TCP/IP**.
